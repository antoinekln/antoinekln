## Hi there 👋

I'm **Antoine Klein**, a **data scientist and AI engineer** with one simple obsession: making technology actually useful.

In my journey, I’ve worked on several AI app for the French Armed Forces, built eco-impact models at Orange, and developed custom web platforms. Whether it’s AI, data, or web tools, I care about building solutions that matter — for users, not for vanity metrics.

Beyond coding, I love explaining AI to non-experts. I've had the chance to be a conference speaker in schools and businesses, making complex topics simple and concrete. For me, it's not about the hype — it’s about what AI can do for people, here and now.
